    Life expectancy refers to the number of years a person is expected to live based on the statistical average. Life expectancy captures the mortality along the entire life course. It is able to tell us the average age of death in a population, thus being a key metric for assessing population health.  
  </p>
  <p style="text-align:left">
    Since the 19th century, there has been a huge improvment in life expectancy of humans all around the world. However, the inequality of life experience is still very large accross and within countries. In 2019 itself, the country with the lowest life expectancy
    is Central African Republic with 53 years, whereas the life expectancy of Japan is 30 years longer.

  <h1 style="font-family:Lato;text-align:left">Change in Life Expectancy over time.</h1>
  <p style="text-align:left"> 
    The two maps below shows how Life Expectancy has improved over the last 29 years.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align:left"> 
    Improvements can be seen all over the over. However the most noticeable difference is in the poverty struck african continent. Despite fighting against extreme poverty, the entire african continent
    managed to improve their life expectancy from and average of low 50's to 60 and even achieving 70 years in some countries.

  <p style="text-align:left"> This may be due to the differences in chromosomes and hormones between men and women affect longevity. For example, males tend to have more fat surrounding the organs (they have more ‘visceral fat’) whereas women tend to have more fat sitting directly under the skin (‘subcutaneous fat’). This difference is determined both by estrogen and the presence of the second X chromosome in females; and it matters for longevity because fat surrounding the organs predicts cardiovascular disease.</p>

  <h1 style="font-family:Lato;text-align:left">Is there a link between healthcare expenditure and life expectancy?</h1>
  <p style="text-align:left">One common way of measuring national healthcare consumption and production is to estimate aggregate expenditure on healthcare.</p>
  <p style="text-align:left">The visualization below shows the cross-country relationship between life expectancy at birth and healthcare expenditure per capita. </p>

  <p style="text-align:left">Noticeably, the trend is obvious as improvements can be through out the continents. As the expenditure on healthcare increases, so does the life expectancy.
  However, also notice that this chart seems to follow a pattern of ‘diminishing returns’, which means that the increase in life expectancy associated with an increase in healthcare 
  expenditure decreases as expenditure increases</p>
