    Life expectancy refers to the number of years a person is expected to live based on the statistical average. Life expectancy captures the mortality along the entire life course. It is able to tell us the average age of death in a population, thus being a key metric for assessing population health.  
  </p>
  <p style="text-align:left">
    Since the 19th century, there has been a huge improvment in life expectancy of humans all around the world. However, the inequality of life experience is still very large accross and within countries. In 2019 itself, the country with the lowest life expectancy
    is Central African Republic with 53 years, whereas the life expectancy of Japan is 30 years longer.

  <h1 style="font-family:Lato;text-align:left">Change in Life Expectancy over time.</h1>
  <p style="text-align:left"> 
    The two maps below shows how Life Expectancy has improved over the last 29 years.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align:left"> 
    Improvements can be seen all over the over. However the most noticeable difference is in the poverty struck african continent. Despite fighting against extreme poverty, the entire african continent
    managed to improve their life expectancy from and average of low 50's to 60 and even achieving 70 years in some countries.

  <p style="text-align:left"> This may be due to the differences in chromosomes and hormones between men and women affect longevity. For example, males tend to have more fat surrounding the organs (they have more ‘visceral fat’) whereas women tend to have more fat sitting directly under the skin (‘subcutaneous fat’). This difference is determined both by estrogen and the presence of the second X chromosome in females; and it matters for longevity because fat surrounding the organs predicts cardiovascular disease.</p>

<section class="w3-container w3-center w3-content">
  <p style="text-align:left">One common way of measuring national healthcare consumption and production is to estimate aggregate expenditure on healthcare.</p>

  <p style="text-align:left">Noticeably, a trend in improvements can be seen through out the continents. As the expenditure on healthcare increases, so does the life expectancy.
  However, also notice that this chart seems to follow a pattern of ‘diminishing returns’, which means that the increase in life expectancy associated with an increase in healthcare 
  expenditure decreases as expenditure increases</p>

  <p style="text-align:left"> Is there a correlation between life expectancy and life satisfaction? The table below shows the most populated countries of each continent and what their life satisfaction is compared to their life expectancy. </p>
  <p style="font-size:13px;font-style:italic;text-align:left">Note: Continents are displayed as their respective codes.<br>

  <p style="text-align:left"> From the table above, there seems to be a relation where countries with higher life expectancy tend to be more satisfied with their lives. However,
     is this visualisation enough for us to conclude that those who are expected to live longer tend to be more satisfied with their lives? 
  </p>
  <p style="text-align:left">
    If you've noticed, majority of countries who have low level of life satisfaction are from the african continent. This observation brings us to another question.
     Why is it that countries from the African continent have low level of life satisfaction? One reason might be the ongoing 
    <a href="https://www.odi.org/publications/1440-fighting-poverty-africa-are-prsps-making-difference" style="color:blue"> fight against poverty in Africa</a>.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align:left"> 
    Though the link between life expectancy and life satisfaction is present, other factors such as economic status of the country plays a larger role in affecting life
    satisfaction of countries.<br>

    Due to the improvements in the medical field, the life expectancy of human is expected to keep growing as time goes on. However, will be be a limit as to how long
    humans can live? There is a debate among longevity researchers regarding this topic, some felt that humans were only meant to live up to 100 years at max and some 
    have claimed that the maximum possible age of a humna ranges between 150 to 200 years.<br>
